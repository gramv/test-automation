# TernKey Automated Testing Framework

## Overview

The TernKey Automated Testing Framework implements a comprehensive testing strategy that combines Jest for unit testing and Cypress for integration and end-to-end (E2E) testing. Our testing approach follows a structured workflow that ensures code quality through automated testing integrated with our continuous integration and deployment pipeline.

## Testing Tools and Framework

Our testing framework utilizes two primary tools that work together to provide comprehensive test coverage:

Jest serves as our unit testing framework, allowing us to test individual components and functions in isolation. It provides a robust environment for testing business logic and utility functions.

Cypress handles our integration and E2E testing needs. It enables us to test how different parts of our application work together and verify complete user journeys through our application.

## Getting Started

Setting up the testing environment requires the following prerequisites:
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)
- Git

To set up the testing environment:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd Test-Automation
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests with Jest

To execute unit tests:
```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Integration and E2E Tests with Cypress

To run Cypress tests:
```bash
# Open Cypress Test Runner
npm run cypress:open

# Run Cypress tests headlessly
npm run cypress:run
```

## Automated Testing Workflow

Our testing workflow follows the established pattern shown in our workflow diagram:

1. Development Environment
   - Developers work in their local environment
   - Run unit tests locally before committing changes

2. Pull Request Creation
   - Creating a pull request triggers automated tests
   - All test suites run automatically:
     - Unit tests verify individual components
     - Integration tests check component interactions
     - E2E tests verify complete user journeys

3. Test Evaluation
   - All tests must pass before merging is allowed
   - Coverage requirements must be met
   - Failed tests prevent merging until resolved

4. Staging Deployment
   - Successful tests trigger staging deployment
   - Additional manual quality assurance is performed

5. Production Deployment
   - Final verification in staging environment
   - Successful verification leads to production deployment

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
Our unit tests focus on testing individual components and functions in isolation. These tests reside in the __tests__ directory and verify that each unit of code works as expected.

### Integration Tests
Integration tests in the cypress/integration directory verify that different parts of our application work together correctly. These tests check component interactions and API integrations.

### End-to-End Tests
E2E tests in the cypress/e2e directory validate complete user journeys through our application. These tests ensure that user flows work correctly from start to finish.

## Best Practices

When writing tests, follow these guidelines:

1. Keep tests focused on a single functionality
2. Use descriptive test names that explain the test's purpose
3. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test structure
4. Maintain test independence to prevent interdependencies
5. Use meaningful assertions that verify expected behavior

## Continuous Integration

Our workflow configuration in the workflows directory manages our continuous integration process:

1. Automatically runs all tests on pull request creation
2. Executes the complete test suite in parallel
3. Reports test results and coverage metrics
4. Controls the deployment process based on test results

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
2. Ensure the application is running for integration and E2E tests
3. Check that environment variables are set correctly
4. Review test logs for specific error messages
5. Verify that the test database is properly configured
